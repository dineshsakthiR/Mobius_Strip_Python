# M√∂bius Strip - 3D Parametric Modeling in Python

This project models a **M√∂bius strip** using parametric equations and computes its key geometric properties such as surface area and edge length. It includes a clean and modular Python script with optional 3D visualization.

## üìÅ Structure

- `mobius_strip.py` ‚Äî Core Python script defining the `MobiusStrip` class.
- `README.md` ‚Äî This file.
- `plot.png` ‚Äî (Optional) 3D screenshot of the M√∂bius strip.

## üîß Features

- Generate a 3D mesh/grid of (x, y, z) points using parametric equations.
- Compute:
  - Surface area using numerical integration
  - Edge length of the M√∂bius strip
- Optional 3D visualization using Matplotlib

## üßÆ Parametric Equations Used

x(u,v) = (R + v _ cos(u/2)) _ cos(u)
y(u,v) = (R + v _ cos(u/2)) _ sin(u)
z(u,v) = v \* sin(u/2)

Where:
u ‚àà [0, 2œÄ]
v ‚àà [‚àíw/2, w/2]

These equations describe a M√∂bius strip using two parameters:

- `u`: along the length of the strip
- `v`: across the width of the strip

## üìú How I Structured the Code

- **Class-Based Design**: The `MobiusStrip` class encapsulates all logic for mesh generation, surface area, and edge length calculations.
- **Methods**:
  - `generate_mesh()`: Creates the 3D coordinates using meshgrids.
  - `compute_surface_area()`: Uses numerical approximation over the surface.
  - `compute_edge_length()`: Sums distances along the edge using discretization.
- **Visualization** is done using `matplotlib` for interactive 3D plotting (optional).

## üìê How I Approximated Surface Area

To compute the surface area numerically:

- I used numerical integration over a mesh grid generated from the parametric equations.
- The area of each small surface patch was approximated using vector cross products of partial derivatives.
- Total surface area = Sum of all local patch areas over the (u, v) grid.

This method helps approximate the surface area even for curved and twisted surfaces like a M√∂bius strip.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- Initially, I couldn't fully understand the problem statement ‚Äî especially the meaning of the parametric equations and what was expected for surface area and edge length computation.
- I used **ChatGPT** to understand the parametric equations and how to implement mesh generation, numerical integration, and visualization in Python.
- Once I understood it clearly, it became easier to modularize the code and work on each part step by step.
- Ensuring numerical stability and accurate approximation using discrete points was tricky.
- Visualizing the M√∂bius strip cleanly took some trial and error, especially for choosing the right resolution and view angles.
